# LexonFabric MCP Validation

## Status

Draft specification patch derived from
`docs/specs/lexonfabric-mcp/requirements.md` and
`docs/specs/lexonfabric-mcp/design.md`.

## Validation Scope

These validation entries define the expected conformance surface for the
LexonFabric-owned `lexonfabric-mcp` boundary.

This package validates LexonFabric's MCP contract, delegated search and
retrieval wiring, source-name preservation, and environment-specific dependency
selection. It does not redefine validation already owned by LexonGraph for
search semantics or delegated dependency traits.

## Validation Entries

### VAL-LFM-001

Inspect the MCP server surface for `lexonfabric-mcp`.

**Pass condition:** the server exposes chunk-returning search operations and
named retrieval operations for email, thread, and document items.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-001, RQ-MCP-003, RQ-MCP-005, DSG-LFM-002

### VAL-LFM-002

Execute a representative search through the MCP surface.

**Pass condition:** the MCP response returns content chunks delegated from the
underlying LexonGraph search flow rather than only top-level item identifiers.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-002, RQ-MCP-003, DSG-LFM-001, DSG-LFM-003

### VAL-LFM-003

Execute a representative search whose delegated result includes source-item
names.

**Pass condition:** `lexonfabric-mcp` preserves the delegated source name in
the MCP response for email, thread, or document-backed chunk results when that
metadata is present upstream.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-004, DSG-LFM-003

### VAL-LFM-004

Execute named retrieval requests for representative email, thread, and document
items.

**Pass condition:** each operation delegates retrieval for its item class and
returns the requested item when the delegated lookup succeeds.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-005, DSG-LFM-004

### VAL-LFM-005

Execute named retrieval requests that do not resolve successfully through the
delegated retrieval flow.

**Pass condition:** `lexonfabric-mcp` surfaces the delegated unsuccessful
lookup outcome rather than returning a success-shaped response or inventing a
repository-local fallback result.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-005, RQ-MCP-011, DSG-LFM-004, DSG-LFM-009

### VAL-LFM-006

Run the local/testing environment profile.

**Pass condition:** `lexonfabric-mcp` selects local filesystem-backed storage
or block access and the local embedding service when the delegated search flow
requires embeddings, without changing the MCP contract.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-006, RQ-MCP-007, DSG-LFM-005, DSG-LFM-006, DSG-LFM-007

### VAL-LFM-007

Run the production environment profile.

**Pass condition:** `lexonfabric-mcp` selects Azure Blob Storage-backed storage
or block access and Azure OpenAI when the delegated search flow requires
embeddings, without changing the MCP contract.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-006, RQ-MCP-007, DSG-LFM-005, DSG-LFM-006, DSG-LFM-007

### VAL-LFM-008

Run the same logical MCP interactions once in local/testing mode and once in
production mode.

**Pass condition:** the operation families, response categories, and delegated
search ownership model remain the same while only environment-specific adapter
realizations differ.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-007, RQ-MCP-009, RQ-MCP-012, DSG-LFM-006, DSG-LFM-007

### VAL-LFM-009

Inspect the `lexonfabric-mcp` specification package against indexer artifacts.

**Pass condition:** no MCP artifact in this package redefines indexing
contracts, indexing-time orchestration, or content-resolution behavior owned by
the indexer boundary.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-010, DSG-LFM-008

### VAL-LFM-010

Inspect the `lexonfabric-mcp` specification package against delegated
LexonGraph contracts.

**Pass condition:** the package remains subordinate to delegated LexonGraph
search and dependency contracts and does not redefine their search semantics,
ranking semantics, or storage semantics.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-002, RQ-MCP-011, DSG-LFM-001, DSG-LFM-009, DSG-LFM-011

### VAL-LFM-011

Add a new content type beyond the initial email, thread, and document surface.

**Pass condition:** the new content type can be introduced by extending
delegated routing and result projection without redefining the core chunk-search
contract or the environment-selection contract.

**Traces to:** RQ-MCP-008, RQ-MCP-012, DSG-LFM-010
