# LexonFabric Scale Test Validation

## Status

Phase 2 validation patch for the approved local rsync-driven stress-test
wrapper in `docs/specs/lexonfabric-scale-test/requirements.md` and
`docs/specs/lexonfabric-scale-test/design.md`.

## Validation Scope

These validation entries define the expected conformance surface for the
LexonFabric-owned `lexonfabric-scale-test` boundary.

This package validates wrapper-owned orchestration, generated request
compatibility, delegated execution, and root handoff output. It does not
redefine validation already owned by `lexonfabric-indexer`, LexonGraph, or
`lexonfabric-mcp`.

## Validation Entries

### VAL-LST-001

Inspect the repository surface for `lexonfabric-scale-test`.

**Pass condition:** the tool is specified as a separate wrapper/test boundary
above the existing indexer flow rather than as part of `lexonfabric-indexer`.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-001, RQ-SCALE-012, DSG-LST-001

### VAL-LST-002

Inspect the first executable realization shape for `lexonfabric-scale-test`.

**Pass condition:** the tool is realizable as a lightweight Linux-local
operator form such as a bash script and does not require a long-lived service
or dedicated Rust crate in the first increment.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-003A, RQ-SCALE-009A, DSG-LST-002, DSG-LST-008

### VAL-LST-003

Execute a representative local run with one rsync URL.

**Pass condition:** the wrapper fetches mailbox content from the rsync source,
discovers mailbox files from the fetched mirror, generates an indexer-compatible
request/config artifact, invokes the downstream parser/indexer flow, and
produces root handoff output in the approved stage order.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-002, RQ-SCALE-003, RQ-SCALE-004, RQ-SCALE-005,
RQ-SCALE-006, RQ-SCALE-007, DSG-LST-003, DSG-LST-004, DSG-LST-005,
DSG-LST-006, DSG-LST-007

### VAL-LST-004

Inspect the generated request/config artifact produced from discovered mailbox
files.

**Pass condition:** the artifact is compatible with the existing local indexer
contract and does not require the downstream indexer to understand rsync URLs
directly.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-004, RQ-SCALE-005, RQ-SCALE-010, DSG-LST-005,
DSG-LST-006, DSG-LST-010

### VAL-LST-005

Execute a representative local run with multiple rsync URLs.

**Pass condition:** the wrapper combines the discovered mailbox set into one
logical generated request artifact and one logical run output set rather than
producing disconnected per-source result contracts in the first increment.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-011, DSG-LST-005A

### VAL-LST-006

Inspect the root handoff artifact from a completed run.

**Pass condition:** the wrapper emits a machine-consumable artifact that
identifies the produced block-tree root and remains compatible with the
existing summary/root-style output family when practical.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-006, RQ-SCALE-007, RQ-SCALE-010, DSG-LST-007

### VAL-LST-007

Inspect the wrapper scope against MCP artifacts.

**Pass condition:** `lexonfabric-scale-test` does not generate MCP config
artifacts and does not redefine MCP-serving semantics.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-008, RQ-SCALE-012, DSG-LST-009

### VAL-LST-008

Inspect the wrapper scope against indexer semantics.

**Pass condition:** the wrapper delegates parsing and block-tree generation
through the existing downstream batch/indexer path rather than introducing a
repository-local indexing or parser contract.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-004, RQ-SCALE-012, RQ-SCALE-013, DSG-LST-001,
DSG-LST-006, DSG-LST-010

### VAL-LST-009

Inspect the executable scope against the production boundary.

**Pass condition:** the wrapper is executable for local/testing only, remains
compatible with the repository's container-oriented local profile, and does not
attempt to specify the production ARM/Bicep plus Azure Functions workflow.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-009, RQ-SCALE-009A, DSG-LST-008

### VAL-LST-010

Add a future discovery mode beyond rsync-backed mailbox acquisition.

**Pass condition:** the new mode can be introduced by extending source
acquisition or discovery policy behind the existing wrapper stages without
redefining the top-level wrapper boundary or downstream indexer contract.

**Traces to:** RQ-SCALE-014, DSG-LST-011
